Plays an audio sample file with optional effects. Samples are loaded from a
built-in sample library.

| Prop     | Type               | Default | Description                                        |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | `SampleName`       | —       | **Required.** Sample name (without file extension) |
| `amp`    | `number`           | `1`     | Amplitude/volume multiplier                        |
| `cutoff` | `number` or `Line` | `20000` | Lowpass filter cutoff (MIDI note or Hz)            |
| `rate`   | `number`           | `1`     | Playback rate multiplier                           |
| `pan`    | `number`           | `0`     | Stereo pan position: -1 (left) to 1 (right)        |

### Cutoff Values (MIDI note → Hz)

- `60` → ~262 Hz (C4)
- `80` → ~831 Hz
- `100` → ~2637 Hz
- `110` → ~4699 Hz
- `130` → ~20kHz (no filtering)

```tsx
{/* Basic kick drum */}
<Sample name="bd_haus" />

{/* Louder with filter */}
<Sample name="bd_haus" amp={2} cutoff={100} />

{/* Hi-hat with pitch shift and panning */}
<Sample name="drum_cymbal_closed" rate={1.2} pan={0.3} />

{/* Snare with lowpass filter */}
<Sample name="drum_snare_soft" cutoff={80} amp={0.8} />
