## Line Patterns

The `cutoff` prop on `<Note>`, `<Chord>`, and `<Sample>` components supports
Line patterns for dynamic filter sweeps within a `<Sequence>`:

```tsx
<Sequence interval={0.25}>
  {/* Filter sweeps from 60 to 120 over 8 steps */}
  <Note note="C4" filter={{ cutoff: { from: 60, to: 120, steps: 8 } }} />
  <Note note="E4" filter={{ cutoff: { from: 60, to: 120, steps: 8 } }} />
  <Note note="G4" filter={{ cutoff: { from: 60, to: 120, steps: 8 } }} />
  {/* ... */}
</Sequence>
```

| Property | Type      | Description                       |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `from`   | `number`  | Starting cutoff value (MIDI note) |
| `to`     | `number`  | Ending cutoff value (MIDI note)   |
| `steps`  | `number`  | Number of interpolation steps     |
| `mirror` | `boolean` | If true, goes up then back down   |
| `step`   | `number`  | Manual step index override        |
